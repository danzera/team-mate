# TeamMate - Prime Academy Solo Project
1. TeamMate is a full stack web application that automates the otherwise largely manual process of running a sports team.
2. Managers are able to create a team, set their teamâ€™s schedule and invite players to join. Players are then able to set their availability on a game-by-game basis.
3. Automated e-mails are sent to players 3 days prior to scheduled games, as a reminder. Subsequent e-mails are also sent to players who, much to the chagrin of their manager, have been reluctant to set their game availability.
4. Technologies used: SQL, PostrgreSQL, AngularJS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Passport, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Nodemailer, Grunt, Heroku, Git, GitHub
